just got the report name update to work in reportDefMenuEdit
so now we're off to handle the buttons for the field name selects

client sends request to the controller
controller does any additional stuff
and sends a response to the client

were gonna add a decide statement for what we are doing inside of reportDefMenuEdit

i have a bit of a dilemma.  there is this thing called #working_array the old code references it heavily so i want to use that but
12/28

i also passed around and around but i don't want to do that any more
fuck!  

there is so much the old system does that i do indeed want to use but modernizing the links is difficult in the existing code and the old views are full of code to keep us cycling.  A monstrous waste of time in afterthought.

let's see if we can get the old code executing again and stick in the new stuff we developed in reportDefMenuEdit.

the old code doesn't look so bad.  i'd like to try naming the $to_array which we'd really like named after the field in which it will be stored. this allows us to skip lots of the old code which we'll no longer need, 

when we create the select from to view, we know for which array we're processing: modifiable_fields
12/30

ppv_define_query
$this->working_arrays has to be built after the report_definition is retrieved.
12/31
depending on which button you press on the reportDefMenuEdit screen, you really just go to one of two places. feiled select from to or pulldown pulldown value ppv. what needs to be there has already been built into working_arrays somewhere

	i'm working on querys & bus rules now.  it's moving stuff from putedit41 into reportDefMenuEdit

	#working_arrays has got all this stuff defined and loaded from the db record.  so we've got to hook thatinto our new 'architecture'

2017-01-06
	The query arrays are not the same size
2017-01-12
	build_report_def_arrays
	 grep -rn 'app/Http/Controllers/' -e "snippet_str"
	 grep -rna 'resources/views' -e 'indexmain'

 	find big datasets
 	get putty working on gohoooa
 	try to find old wordpress

 	fuck.  i deleted somethin before i made my last git backup (right when i was doing the save it looks like)
 	so, what i remember isn't there...
 	i know i had to make the arrays the same size and at least 5
2017-01-17
	advanced-query looks like it's working and business-rules
	the missing code was a loop to initialize values that always need to be in sync but i broke that symmetry in testing.

	i think initializing 83445 willfix it.  other ones seem ok. i think padding can be much implerbut we're not looking at that right now; just making it work.
	business_rules_getEdit_blade_gen and advanced_query_getEdit_blade_gen_new are both
	ppv_edit_snippet_gen s (a name i just made up) we're moving to that instead.  behaviour is identical; just data changes.

	at 10:08
	business rules updated! (time to feed the dogs)

	i am currently trying to get browseEdit to work
	i'm on the front side of building the query.  After i get the arrays matched up, everything else 'should work'

	i have successfully executed the query but we need something new to build browseEditSnippet

	im trying to make working_arrays_construct do everything regardless of what_we_are_doing flag.

017-01-20
	query is working

	i am trying to get the browse edit to work like the other guys do now.  we'll see how close i stay to that.

	Up! still seems as if it should be top priority

	the routines weren't even copied into the new modules to gen the snippets for the field names row and the 'browse edit snippet'.  they are now but they properly belong as part of the update process.

	there are all kinds of snippets in the record and i'm only aware of a few of them even though i created all of them. i think i should print the field names and then go thru and document or delete them.  Perhaps group them.  

	a downside of breaking DEHBaseController up is I'm sure to miss something i spent a lot of time working on but there are so many clones and backups in the code.

	i don't want everything in misc things.  i think the string stuff should be separate but maybe
2017-01-21
	i'm trying to name and load everything into $working_arrays
	one guy is getting passed an object which he deftly handles.  then he's passed the first occurrence of an object which he chokes on maybe that's backwards but different input...

	also, don't forget that the lookups are far more extensive than you remember  so hold onto the old stuff among other things
2017-01-23 go falcons
	we get to the page but nothing renders.  (a fantasy milestone) 

	of course we want to create the define the file names so we don't have to pass all their components individually.

	i am going back and forth between reportDefMenuEdit blowing up when i make changes in the browse.  id is not being passed consistently. still testing

	i'd probably like the generators to be able to set their name and whether to gen as an object or an array

	we are deciding some stuff needs to be changed and some of that will require adhocs to change the data. e.g. some records will abend whereas newer ones work just fine 

	the browse works... anti-climatic
	but i want to use it to look at things as soon as it's working so that's a good sign

	NOT ALL REPORTS WORK
	I want to make the r_o array save values instead of indexes.  some conversion will be needed
2017-01-24
	perhaps i should be more elated.  simple queries work. more proof of concept than gorilla testing but browse works consistently in several places

	the 'short list'
	1.make sure all browses are working
	2.
2017-01-26
	i've gotten thru browse edit although there is still some bad data out there.
	editupdate needs to have the report_definition key so it canretrieve the business rules.

	we've got the key in IndexReports 
2017-01-27
	putEdit2new is what the old system calls for editUpdate.  it's got all kinds of lookup shit that i've kind of forgotten about so i want to copy it inside of editUpdate.  But, the old code IS old so we're gonna take a quick look (and start remembering about lookups)

	what_we_are_doing has already been introduced so already that was agreat idea.
	it previously got if from input but now it's passed in. sofar so good.

	it's easier to look in the execution of the old code (with a display) to just tell us what we need to set it to.  off to train the girls.
2017-01-28
	editUpdate comes up in what is called edit2new.blade
	i still don't know how the lookups popup but they do. field_names

	the update hasn't been tested but the fields need to be defined so they can be updated .

	i want to get the logon back into the mix but am not sure how hard that will be.  There's no sense working on the menuing till this is working again

	the obvious place to start is web in the old larablues.
2017-01-29
	we think we want to move the string genning stuff into DEHBaseController but not quiteon the top of the list

	we are not generating the editUpdate snippet.  it needs to  be built when modifiable_fields is being updated

	we gen the edit snippet whenever we go into edit.  the snippet's not quite right.  perhaps we're building something other than what we're deploying.

	$working_arrays has good data so we're using it.  SOme of this encoded shit isn't needed so i'm going to start eliminating them where i can
2017-01-31
	business_rules_ppv_build_them is where validation_array is currently being built
2017-02-02
	we are closing in on the update.   we're gonna include it in the table as business_rules_array and a file of the same name that we can include. maybe we'll build it in $working_arrays

2017-02-03
	didn't write to loretta
	when you get to editUpdate, you've picked a data record you want to edit 
	we use the report description key to get the fields we want to edit and build an edit snippet.  the view includes the snippet and you pass it the record you picked. why don't it work? 
2017-02-04
	not feeling quite ecstatic but update has worked for everybody.

	But, I'm using the snippet_connection for everything.  it works now since i'm updating miscThings.

	i think i want to get rid of all the database connections from config/database.php and insert the snippet connection and the data connection.

	i also need to get the user and misc things tables linked

	we need to use the db to get the default connections 

	it's making it look like we need at least one more kind of lookup/setup
	ppp pulldown pulldown pulldown

Fluent:

DB::table('table_name')->distinct()->get(['column_name']);

Eloquent:

MyModel::distinct()->get(['column_name']);

we added in some of the old routes and it got started asking for a login

now, we need to modify the link to indexreports in indexmain because I added id as a parameter to index reports

we had to do something here

PHP Youtube and Vimeo Video Downloader Script

2017-02-07
	The login is somehow working again!  i know i changed (or added) something and then un-commented all of the 'new' stuff and we were back in business.  Miscthings controlller is the best guy and does the most things and uses the best technology but he's way more complicated than everybody needs to be

	i want to move some of those string generators over to DEH

<a href="{{ URL::route($node_name.'.reportDefMenuEdit', $parameters = array('id'=>$id, 'what_we_are_doing'=>'maintain_modifiable_fields','coming_from'=> 'reportDefMenuEdit')) }}" class="btn mycart-btn-row2">maintain_modifiable_fields</a>

i think we can start updating the buttons 
All buttons should work for the demo (ya think)
ppv_update et all should return to repDefMenuEdit after update

i'd like to make the query ro array store values instead of index values so i'll need something to find the bad ones and correct them as well as the logic to make what's there work after the changes.

more advanced queries at least show task

both snippet add and data add have yet to be upgraded

i gotta get back over and get gohoooa's blog back up

couldn't a query find all of the records we're looking for
more to do but this list is already getting long
here's lots of cleanup as well

i wanna start loading the default values for the two connections from the database
i think that will mean less has to be defined for the controller screen.

update from reportDefMenuEdit should return there
