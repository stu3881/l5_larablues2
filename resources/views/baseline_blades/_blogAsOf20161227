just got the report name update to work in reportDefMenuEdit
so now we're off to handle the buttons for the field name selects

client sends request to the controller
controller does any additional stuff
and sends a response to the client

were gonna add a decide statement for what we are doing inside of reportDefMenuEdit

i have a bit of a dilemma.  there is this thing called #working_array the old code references it heavily so i want to use that but
12/28

i also passed around and around but i don't want to do that any more
fuck!  

there is so much the old system does that i do indeed want to use but modernizing the links is difficult in the existing code and the old views are full of code to keep us cycling.  A monstrous waste of time in afterthought.

let's see if we can get the old code executing again and stick in the new stuff we developed in reportDefMenuEdit.

the old code doesn't look so bad.  i'd like to try naming the $to_array which we'd really like named after the field in which it will be stored. this allows us to skip lots of the old code which we'll no longer need, 

when we create the select from to view, we know for which array we're processing: modifiable_fields
12/30

ppv_define_query
$this->working_arrays has to be built after the report_definition is retrieved.
12/31
depending on which button you press on the reportDefMenuEdit screen, you really just go to one of two places. feiled select from to or pulldown pulldown value ppv. what needs to be there has already been built into working_arrays somewhere

	i'm working on querys & bus rules now.  it's moving stuff from putedit41 into reportDefMenuEdit

	#working_arrays has got all this stuff defined and loaded from the db record.  so we've got to hook thatinto our new 'architecture'

2017-01-06
	The query arrays are not the same size
2017-01-12
	build_report_def_arrays
	 grep -rn 'app/Http/Controllers/' -e "snippet_str"
	 grep -rna 'resources/views' -e 'indexmain'

 	find big datasets
 	get putty working on gohoooa
 	try to find old wordpress

 	fuck.  i deleted somethin before i made my last git backup (right when i was doing the save it looks like)
 	so, what i remember isn't there...
 	i know i had to make the arrays the same size and at least 5
2017-01-17
	advanced-query looks like it's working and business-rules
	the missing code was a loop to initialize values that always need to be in sync but i broke that symmetry in testing.

	i think initializing 83445 willfix it.  other ones seem ok. i think padding can be much implerbut we're not looking at that right now; just making it work.
	business_rules_getEdit_blade_gen and advanced_query_getEdit_blade_gen_new are both
	ppv_edit_snippet_gen s (a name i just made up) we're moving to that instead.  behaviour is identical; just data changes.

	at 10:08
	business rules updated! (time to feed the dogs)
	2017-01-19
	i am currently trying to get browseEdit to work
	i'm on the front side of building the query.  After i get the arrays matched up, everything else 'should work'

	i have successfully executed the query but we need something new to build browseEditSnippet

	im trying to make working_arrays_construct do everything regardless of what_we_are_doing flag.

017-01-20
	query is working

	i am trying to get the browse edit to work like the other guys do now.  we'll see how close i stay to that.

	Up! still seems as if it should be top priority

	the routines weren't even copied into the new modules to gen the snippets for the field names row and the 'browse edit snippet'.  they are now but they properly belong as part of the update process.

	there are all kinds of snippets in the record and i'm only aware of a few of them even though i created all of them. i think i should print the field names and then go thru and document or delete them.  Perhaps group them.  

	a downside of breaking DEHBaseController up is I'm sure to miss something i spent a lot of time working on but there are so many clones and backups in the code.

	i don't want everything in misc things.  i think the string stuff should be separate but maybe
2017-01-21
	i'm trying to name and load everything into $working_arrays
	one guy is getting passed an object which he deftly handles.  then he's passed the first occurrence of an object which he chokes on maybe that's backwards but different input...

	also, don't forget that the lookups are far more extensive than you remember  so hold onto the old stuff among other things
2017-01-23 go falcons
	we get to the page but nothing renders.  (a fantasy milestone) 

	of course we want to create the define the file names so we don't have to pass all their components individually.

	i am going back and forth between reportDefMenuEdit blowing up when i make changes in the browse.  id is not being passed consistently. still testing

	i'd probably like the generators to be able to set their name and whether to gen as an object or an array

	we are deciding some stuff needs to be changed and some of that will require adhocs to change the data. e.g. some records will abend whereas newer ones work just fine 

	the browse works... anti-climatic
	but i want to use it to look at things as soon as it's working so that's a good sign

	NOT ALL REPORTS WORK
	I want to make the r_o array save values instead of indexes.  some conversion will be needed
2017-01-24
	perhaps i should be more elated.  simple queries work. more proof of concept than gorilla testing but browse works consistently in several places

	the 'short list'
	1.make sure all browses are working
	2.
2017-01-26
	i've gotten thru browse edit although there is still some bad data out there.
	editupdate needs to have the report_definition key so it canretrieve the business rules.

	we've got the key in IndexReports 
2017-01-27
	putEdit2new is what the old system calls for editUpdate.  it's got all kinds of lookup shit that i've kind of forgotten about so i want to copy it inside of editUpdate.  But, the old code IS old so we're gonna take a quick look (and start remembering about lookups)

	what_we_are_doing has already been introduced so already that was agreat idea.
	it previously got if from input but now it's passed in. sofar so good.

	it's easier to look in the execution of the old code (with a display) to just tell us what we need to set it to.  off to train the girls.
2017-01-28
	editUpdate comes up in what is called edit2new.blade
	i still don't know how the lookups popup but they do. field_names

	the update hasn't been tested but the fields need to be defined so they can be updated .

	i want to get the logon back into the mix but am not sure how hard that will be.  There's no sense working on the menuing till this is working again

	the obvious place to start is web in the old larablues.
2017-01-29
	we think we want to move the string genning stuff into DEHBaseController but not quiteon the top of the list

	we are not generating the editUpdate snippet.  it needs to  be built when modifiable_fields is being updated

	we gen the edit snippet whenever we go into edit.  the snippet's not quite right.  perhaps we're building something other than what we're deploying.

	$working_arrays has good data so we're using it.  SOme of this encoded shit isn't needed so i'm going to start eliminating them where i can
2017-01-31
	business_rules_ppv_build_them is where validation_array is currently being built
2017-02-02
	we are closing in on the update.   we're gonna include it in the table as business_rules_array and a file of the same name that we can include. maybe we'll build it in $working_arrays

2017-02-03
	didn't write to loretta
	when you get to editUpdate, you've picked a data record you want to edit 
	we use the report description key to get the fields we want to edit and build an edit snippet.  the view includes the snippet and you pass it the record you picked. why don't it work? 
2017-02-04
	not feeling quite ecstatic but update has worked for everybody.

	But, I'm using the snippet_connection for everything.  it works now since i'm updating miscThings.

	i think i want to get rid of all the database connections from config/database.php and insert the snippet connection and the data connection.

	i also need to get the user and misc things tables linked

	we need to use the db to get the default connections 

	it's making it look like we need at least one more kind of lookup/setup
	ppp pulldown pulldown pulldown

https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/eloquent/the-sql-select-distinct-statement
Fluent:

DB::table('table_name')->distinct()->get(['column_name']);

Eloquent:

MyModel::distinct()->get(['column_name']);

we added in some of the old routes and it got started asking for a login

now, we need to modify the link to indexreports in indexmain because I added id as a parameter to index reports

we had to do something here

PHP Youtube and Vimeo Video Downloader Script
https://www.phpclasses.org/package/10144-PHP-Download-YouTube-or-Vimeo-videos.html

2017-02-07
	The login is somehow working again!  i know i changed (or added) something and then un-commented all of the 'new' stuff and we were back in business.  Miscthings controlller is the best guy and does the most things and uses the best technology but he's way more complicated than everybody needs to be

	i want to move some of those string generators over to DEH

<a href="{{ URL::route($node_name.'.reportDefMenuEdit', $parameters = array('id'=>$id, 'what_we_are_doing'=>'maintain_modifiable_fields','coming_from'=> 'reportDefMenuEdit')) }}" class="btn mycart-btn-row2">maintain_modifiable_fields</a>

i think we can start updating the buttons 
All buttons should work for the demo (ya think)
ppv_update et all should return to repDefMenuEdit after update

i'd like to make the query ro array store values instead of index values so i'll need something to find the bad ones and correct them as well as the logic to make what's there work after the changes.

more advanced queries at least show task

both snippet add and data add have yet to be upgraded

i gotta get back over and get gohoooa's blog back up

couldn't a query find all of the records we're looking for
more to do but this list is already getting long
here's lots of cleanup as well

i wanna start loading the default values for the two connections from the database
i think that will mean less has to be defined for the controller screen.

update from reportDefMenuEdit should return there

programmerutilities menu shows up
the adds and the menuing should probably come first
adds for sure
2017-02-09
	the conversion from indexes to values continues.  it's compounded by the fact that we're trying to correct bad ones automatically. (if the value is numeric, we assume it's an indexed array and do a look up on the spot.) 

	building the query isn't handling this correctly right now but it looks like we're doing the conversion right on the update

2017-02-10
	things are in better shape than they feel.
	there are no busines rules; hence marching thru a null array abends. i'm hoping making the paddining routine in working_arrays work the way i want (how many blanks do i want on the end of each array) will fix this
2017-02-14
	I deleted all my cookies for other reasons.

	i think i got the padding working right.  So, we're off to get all the buttons working

	first are the adds.  the report definition name and the others.
2017-02-16
	It's so much nicer doing it the new way.
	we want to make it look like the new update

	the problem with kill is you have to reload your databases.  i do need a more recent backup since i changed the way the indexing works.but not everybody is self correcting

	compact is the opposite of extract 
	extract($var_array, EXTR_PREFIX_SAME, "wddx");
	echo "$color, $size, $shape, $wddx_size\n";
2017-02-17
	The adds have been a lot harder than they should have been.
	A button points you to a route that points you at a controller and off you go
	Input a form, validate and insert or return with errors.

	I guess i need to go thru this one more time.

	A resource controller gets you all of the standard crud methods
	i don't think i'm using them in miscThings

	I'm thinking i want a miscThing Controller but the miscThings controller is doing lost of other stuff and maybe we can do the sqlcalls in the table controller instead of the miscThings controller  something like ::MiscThing

	Anyhow, I'm just going to try and 'clone' how we do the add in example and do the same thing with miscThings

	All that create is go to a form to accept the input data
2017-02-18-19
	I thought it was close and then it slipped away
	i get errors and the messages appear on an update just like they're supposed to
	but on an add, I can see that the validation is taking place but i see no errors

	i cannot see how the validation is returning the error messages in one case and not the other

2017-02-20
	Turns out i was passing an errors array to the view which (apparently) fucked up the real errors.  i removed that and we're FINALLY on to the add of the data record.
	(a very distracted past couple weeks for no reason other than laziness?)

	i don't feel i've put enough in the 'data model' controller.

	i guess what i mean is that there are an awful lot of db calls in miscThings.  It looks like the example does it all in the data model; miscThings is more of an app that makes db calls

	it sure is nice; now that it's working and i can use it to lookk at shit
	i do want to see if i can get distinct to work with a raw query
	but i want to try doing a miscThing::ceate()

	maybe i can create a report_definition that accepts all the fields i need to require.  Table_name and node_name are required fields
2017-02-21
	feels a bit circular.
	created report_definition_rules rport which defines the minimum fields to create a report_definition record.

	i got this hooked in with the initialize a new report button and that works fine. However, just editing comes up with a different set of rules so that's not quite working.  But, being able to define the modifiable fields using the app is GREAT! (and pretty easy to implement).  We defined a property to the class asking to define the report-id for the add.
2017-02-22
	the above works!

	i keep forgetting to mention that (i forgot)

	it's always a little deceptive on the screens in that you see an add button.  What exactly are you adding a new one of. 
2017-02-23
	it's proving difficult to pass the business_rules_array to the create module so, i'm going to:
	1. make a new function create_w_rules_id 
	2. corresponding route
	3. pass it to the create view so it can get passed to the store
2017-02-24
	it displays the right update and add screen but applies the report define business rules
2017-02-25 
	spent too much of yesterday scanning images
	you can rotate an image one hundredth of a degree in gimp!
	convert 100_0945.JPG -auto-level -compress none 18asample.tif
	tesseract 12asample.tif 12aoutputfile

	the business rules are tied to the report.  Either an add or modify needs to apply the same set of rules.

	david.stokes@oracle.com
	http://www.unofficialmysqlguide.com/

	some screen shots of the lookups
	we need a few more fields and a database backup soon

	once a database is identified (in the connection), we know all the tables
	we know who's active by matching the database tables to table controllers table names.
	Those who are active are in the main menu
	you can inactivate a table controller (new field) by setting a flag in the definition
	we need new code to go out to miscThins and get the fields that we defined when we created the table_controller 

2017-03-06
	business rules isn't working for database connection 
		snippet name is supposed to be required

	ii feel invigorated now that most stuff is working

	there's still a on of little things

	i'm feeling like i'm finally starting to see the miscThings controller as a class.
	All the other tables can extend miscThings and the stuff will be there for every other file as well; provided we define a controller for them. maybe we'll include

	maybe we can put in the env?

	left or right buttons
	vertical or horizontal display
	fields for the other three like business_rules (encompassing the field_name, r_o and value arrays)

	I have lost it (I hope it's temporary)
	There are several diferent web pages related to virtualbox all purporting to have a solution for reinstalling virtualbox
	 .  Completely uninstall?  I could still bring up the gui after one of those.  I have tried them all.  Apparently, there was abug in 5.0.16 which is what i attempted to install.  My apps would not come up and did not list in the list of shared folders during vagrant up.  i reinstalled vagrant several times but it always wants to download a fresh version of laravel/homestead which takes an hour and a half with my connection.  i finally decided vagrant was not the culprit.  this was all on my brand new 16.04 machine so i was quite unhappy.  i attempted to go back to 5.0.14 and then to 5.0.  At one point, i downloaded and attempted to install the x386 version.  I am running a 64bit i5 so that just created a big mess.  i think i did an --auto-remove and cleaned upmost of that.

	i split my vagrant and virtualbox downloads into two separate folders

	Homstead.yaml is fucked up again
	FUCK!! i hate this.

	Vagrantfile gets changed to look like homestead.rb?
	/home/stu/Homestead/scripts/homestead.rb

	then homestead.yaml starts giving you error messages but they're not quite right and you can't seem to fix it.

	i destroyed the vm and started over.  
	i was entering my login stuff in l5_larablues2.dev so i feel pretty good that i got the app up.  the config/app.php file is improved and more up to date  I don't like having to rebuild the database but it's not that bad.  

	i think it was something else besides Homestead.yaml that was to blame but we'll find out soon enough

	i still need to add a few new fields but i want to insert them after some existing field.

What is the latest working configuration for vagrant and virtualbox for Ubuntu 16.04?

i have recently upgraded from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 as a fresh install.  I believe i updated to a newer version of vagrant or virtualbox and now the provisioning isn't working.

I'm just looking for a configuration of vagrant and virtualbox that's working for them in 16.04

The only laravel documentation I could find said everything gets tested on vagrant 1.7.  So... I upgraded to 1.7
~/Homestead/projects$ vagrant -v
Vagrant 1.7.4

~/Homestead$ vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
The provider 'virtualbox' that was requested to back the machine
'default' is reporting that it isn't usable on this system. The
reason is shown below:

Vagrant has detected that you have a version of VirtualBox installed
that is not supported. Please install one of the supported versions
listed below to use Vagrant:

I decide that I should upate virtualbox to 5.1 so i change the last character in the big string aboveand try again

sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian '$(lsb_release -cs)' contrib non-free' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list" && wget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add - && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install virtualbox-5.1


i am loading laravel/homestead as my vm so i'm guessing that's what's 5.1.10.  i have not had much luck getting my provisioning to work in 16.04.

i managed to find an old 14.04 disk that provisioned the vm correctly

i get different stuff depending on whether i vagrant up frpm Homestead or Homestead/projects/homestead

vagrantfil in Homestead looks like this:

# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
# you're doing.
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # The most common configuration options are documented and commented below.
  # For a complete reference, please see the online documentation at
  # https://docs.vagrantup.com.

  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
  # boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.
  config.vm.box = "laravel/homestead"

whereas the same file in Homestead/projects/homestead looks like this:

# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

require 'json'
require 'yaml'

VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION ||= "2"
confDir = $confDir ||= File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__))

homesteadYamlPath = confDir + "/Homestead.yaml"
homesteadJsonPath = confDir + "/Homestead.json"

require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/scripts/homestead.rb')

BACK IN BUSINESS

Of course I'm not sure what i did but I am sure that vagrant 1.9.2 and virtualbox 5.0.32 provision correctly in Ubuntu 16.04

The ubuntu virtualbox section says click here to install and it installs 5.0.32

i think i had to delete a couple of files before i reinstalled a different version of vagrant but basically i dbl clicked on the archives i downloaded and ubuntu installed them.  i'm not sure but i thought all you had to do was click on the archives for the virtualbox you wanted and ubuntu would uninstall the old vb and install the new one.

vboxmanage -v is the command to see what's active.

i sure am glad to be on the otehr side of this problem and i can sure tell the difference in how i feel.  i've been feeling aged out the last few days.

    This is with 5.0 of homestead
    1.92 of vagrant
    and 5.0.32 of virtualbox

    the database i restored works for example.app (example.app/books)
    and for l5_larablues

    But, it doesn't work for l5_larablues2 which used to be the closest to the laravel 5.4 upgrade before i broke provisioning in 16.04.  It's the best code but...

    l5_larablues has the best front-end security

    the l5_larablues2 code use values instead of indexes for looking up the query operators.  It means that the snippets have generated code incompatible with the state of the database.  They were kind of adhoc solutions.  it can be figured out.  it would be nice if i kept the code around.

    For me, i want to get that front end security moved over so we're done with the old guy.

    Wouldn't it be nice to be able to detect if we had an old database 'version' and could automatically rebuild the snippets that needed fixing. (snippets stored in the database)

    Now it sounds like getting the database upgraded to come up in l5_larablues2 is most important.

	It's brutal man. 
	Composer keeps apps in sync inside of laravel but I need a few things on my box to configure it and get it started.  They are vagrant, virtualbox and homestead.  You also have to download the virtual machine image but that's semi-automatic.

	the versions i started with on 14.04 are so old you almost can't even download them anymore.  i didn't find out until two days ago that the version number of homestead also comes into play.  i really didn't even know what homestead was, i just copied it into my projects root folder.   That has to be the folder where you start vagrant.

	Anyhow, if all that shit isn't in sync, you can still get the vm up but it won't provision.  (when it provisioned, i knew it was fixed.)
	vagrant 1.9.2
	virtualbox 5.0.32
	homestead 5.0
	that last one took almost two weeks to find.  I went down to 5.0 from 5.1 and all of a sudden we're back in business

	virtualbox provides you a platform on which to run.  vagrant is used to configure a virtual machine on virtualbox and i believe homestead is a laravel app that configures the laravel/machine the way it needs to and passes that off to vagrant.

	So, it feels like the army.  Another battle under your belt but another awaits.

	Now, I have to get my app up in laravel 5.4    it just keeps goin.

	Fuck!  Almost a month to fix this.  I am just now back to where i was when i gave timmy a demo.
	i learned a lot.  i can change releases of vagrant or virtualbox or homestead.  I am up to date with my OS 16.04 and laravel is set to 5.4 in l5_larablues2.  Oh yeah, i know how to provision without having to reload my box.  i don't feel great yet, but definitely better.

	Again, i am glad to be on the other side of that wall
	so we're gonna move a few fields around
	alter table `miscThings` modify db_snippet_connection  after db_schema;
	show columns in 'miscThings';

 alter table `miscThings` modify db_snippet_connection   VARCHAR (100) 	AFTER  `db_schema`;
 alter table `miscThings` modify db_data_connection  VARCHAR (100) 		AFTER  `db_schema`;
 alter table `miscThings` modify user_id  int (11) 						AFTER  `id`;

 alter table `miscThings` modify db_snippet_connection  VARCHAR (100) 	AFTER  `key_field_name`;
 alter table `miscThings` modify db_data_connection  VARCHAR (100) 		AFTER  `db_snippet_connection`;
 alter table `miscThings` modify user_id  int (11) 						AFTER  `db_data_connection`;



alter table `miscThings` add business_rules_array varchar(100) default NULL AFTER  `business_rules`;
alter table `miscThings` add query_array  varchar(100) default NULL 		AFTER  `query_value_array `;
alter table `miscThings` add business_rules_array varchar(100) default NULL AFTER  `business_rules`;

alter table `miscThings` drop business_rules_array ;
alter table `miscThings` drop query_array  ;
alter table `miscThings` drop business_rules_array;

This stuff has to be done thru artisan and migrate

i updated github creating v0.0.5.8
the first backup after converting to 16.04 and laravel 5.4
