just got the report name update to work in reportDefMenuEdit
so now we're off to handle the buttons for the field name selects

client sends request to the controller
controller does any additional stuff
and sends a response to the client

were gonna add a decide statement for what we are doing inside of reportDefMenuEdit

i have a bit of a dilemma.  there is this thing called #working_array the old code references it heavily so i want to use that but
12/28

i also passed around and around but i don't want to do that any more
fuck!  

there is so much the old system does that i do indeed want to use but modernizing the links is difficult in the existing code and the old views are full of code to keep us cycling.  A monstrous waste of time in afterthought.

let's see if we can get the old code executing again and stick in the new stuff we developed in reportDefMenuEdit.

the old code doesn't look so bad.  i'd like to try naming the $to_array which we'd really like named after the field in which it will be stored. this allows us to skip lots of the old code which we'll no longer need, 

when we create the select from to view, we know for which array we're processing: modifiable_fields

ppv_define_query
$this->working_arrays has to be built after the report_definition is retrieved.

depending on which button you press on the reportDefMenuEdit screen, you really just go to one of two places. feiled select from to or pulldown pulldown value ppv. what needs to be there has already been built into working_arrays somewhere

	i'm working on querys & bus rules now.  it's moving stuff from putedit41 into reportDefMenuEdit

	#working_arrays has got all this stuff defined and loaded from the db record.  so we've got to hook thatinto our new 'architecture'

	The query arrays are not the same size
2017-01-12
	build_report_def_arrays
	 grep -rn 'app/Http/Controllers/' -e "snippet_str"
	 grep -rna 'resources/views' -e 'indexmain'

 	find big datasets
 	get putty working on gohoooa
 	try to find old wordpress

 	fuck.  i deleted somethin before i made my last git backup (right when i was doing the save it looks like)
 	so, what i remember isn't there...
 	i know i had to make the arrays the same size and at least 5

	advanced-query looks like it's working and business-rules
	the missing code was a loop to initialize values that always need to be in sync but i broke that symmetry in testing.

	i think initializing 83445 willfix it.  other ones seem ok. i think padding can be much implerbut we're not looking at that right now; just making it work.
	business_rules_getEdit_blade_gen and advanced_query_getEdit_blade_gen_new are both
	ppv_edit_snippet_gen s (a name i just made up) we're moving to that instead.  behaviour is identical; just data changes.
