just got the report name update to work in reportDefMenuEdit
so now we're off to handle the buttons for the field name selects

client sends request to the controller
controller does any additional stuff
and sends a response to the client

were gonna add a decide statement for what we are doing inside of reportDefMenuEdit

i have a bit of a dilemma.  there is this thing called #working_array the old code references it heavily so i want to use that but
12/28

i also passed around and around but i don't want to do that any more
fuck!  

there is so much the old system does that i do indeed want to use but modernizing the links is difficult in the existing code and the old views are full of code to keep us cycling.  A monstrous waste of time in afterthought.

let's see if we can get the old code executing again and stick in the new stuff we developed in reportDefMenuEdit.

the old code doesn't look so bad.  i'd like to try naming the $to_array which we'd really like named after the field in which it will be stored. this allows us to skip lots of the old code which we'll no longer need, 

when we create the select from to view, we know for which array we're processing: modifiable_fields
12/30

ppv_define_query
$this->working_arrays has to be built after the report_definition is retrieved.
12/31
depending on which button you press on the reportDefMenuEdit screen, you really just go to one of two places. feiled select from to or pulldown pulldown value ppv. what needs to be there has already been built into working_arrays somewhere

	i'm working on querys & bus rules now.  it's moving stuff from putedit41 into reportDefMenuEdit

	#working_arrays has got all this stuff defined and loaded from the db record.  so we've got to hook thatinto our new 'architecture'

2017-01-06
	The query arrays are not the same size
2017-01-12
	build_report_def_arrays
	 grep -rn 'app/Http/Controllers/' -e "snippet_str"
	 grep -rna 'resources/views' -e 'indexmain'

 	find big datasets
 	get putty working on gohoooa
 	try to find old wordpress

 	fuck.  i deleted somethin before i made my last git backup (right when i was doing the save it looks like)
 	so, what i remember isn't there...
 	i know i had to make the arrays the same size and at least 5
2017-01-17
	advanced-query looks like it's working and business-rules
	the missing code was a loop to initialize values that always need to be in sync but i broke that symmetry in testing.

	i think initializing 83445 willfix it.  other ones seem ok. i think padding can be much implerbut we're not looking at that right now; just making it work.
	business_rules_getEdit_blade_gen and advanced_query_getEdit_blade_gen_new are both
	ppv_edit_snippet_gen s (a name i just made up) we're moving to that instead.  behaviour is identical; just data changes.

	at 10:08
	business rules updated! (time to feed the dogs)
	2017-01-19
	i am currently trying to get browseEdit to work
	i'm on the front side of building the query.  After i get the arrays matched up, everything else 'should work'

	i have successfully executed the query but we need something new to build browseEditSnippet

	im trying to make working_arrays_construct do everything regardless of what_we_are_doing flag.

017-01-20
	query is working

	i am trying to get the browse edit to work like the other guys do now.  we'll see how close i stay to that.

	Up! still seems as if it should be top priority

	the routines weren't even copied into the new modules to gen the snippets for the field names row and the 'browse edit snippet'.  they are now but they properly belong as part of the update process.

	there are all kinds of snippets in the record and i'm only aware of a few of them even though i created all of them. i think i should print the field names and then go thru and document or delete them.  Perhaps group them.  

	a downside of breaking DEHBaseController up is I'm sure to miss something i spent a lot of time working on but there are so many clones and backups in the code.

	i don't want everything in misc things.  i think the string stuff should be separate but maybe
2017-01-21
	i'm trying to name and load everything into $working_arrays
	one guy is getting passed an object which he deftly handles.  then he's passed the first occurrence of an object which he chokes on maybe that's backwards but different input...

	also, don't forget that the lookups are far more extensive than you remember  so hold onto the old stuff among other things
2017-01-23 go falcons
	we get to the page but nothing renders.  (a fantasy milestone) 

	of course we want to create the define the file names so we don't have to pass all their components individually.

	i am going back and forth between reportDefMenuEdit blowing up when i make changes in the browse.  id is not being passed consistently. still testing

	i'd probably like the generators to be able to set their name and whether to gen as an object or an array

	we are deciding some stuff needs to be changed and some of that will require adhocs to change the data. e.g. some records will abend whereas newer ones work just fine 

	the browse works... anti-climatic
	but i want to use it to look at things as soon as it's working so that's a good sign

	NOT ALL REPORTS WORK
	I want to make the r_o array save values instead of indexes.  some conversion will be needed
2017-01-24
	perhaps i should be more elated.  simple queries work. more proof of concept than gorilla testing but browse works consistently in several places

	the 'short list'
	1.make sure all browses are working
	2.
2017-01-26
	i've gotten thru browse edit although there is still some bad data out there.
	editupdate needs to have the report_definition key so it canretrieve the business rules.

	we've got the key in IndexReports 
2017-01-27
	putEdit2new is what the old system calls for editUpdate.  it's got all kinds of lookup shit that i've kind of forgotten about so i want to copy it inside of editUpdate.  But, the old code IS old so we're gonna take a quick look (and start remembering about lookups)

	what_we_are_doing has already been introduced so already that was agreat idea.
	it previously got if from input but now it's passed in. sofar so good.

	it's easier to look in the execution of the old code (with a display) to just tell us what we need to set it to.  off to train the girls.
2017-01-28
	editUpdate comes up in what is called edit2new.blade
	i still don't know how the lookups popup but they do. field_names

	the update hasn't been tested but the fields need to be defined so they can be updated .

	i want to get the logon back into the mix but am not sure how hard that will be.  There's no sense working on the menuing till this is working again

	the obvious place to start is web in the old larablues.
2017-01-29
	we think we want to move the string genning stuff into DEHBaseController but not quiteon the top of the list

	we are not generating the editUpdate snippet.  it needs to  be built when modifiable_fields is being updated

	we gen the edit snippet whenever we go into edit.  the snippet's not quite right.  perhaps we're building something other than what we're deploying.

	$working_arrays has good data so we're using it.  SOme of this encoded shit isn't needed so i'm going to start eliminating them where i can
2017-01-31
	business_rules_ppv_build_them is where validation_array is currently being built
2017-02-02
	we are closing in on the update.   we're gonna include it in the table as business_rules_array and a file of the same name that we can include. maybe we'll build it in $working_arrays

2017-02-03
	didn't write to loretta
	when you get to editUpdate, you've picked a data record you want to edit 
	we use the report description key to get the fields we want to edit and build an edit snippet.  the view includes the snippet and you pass it the record you picked. why don't it work? 
2017-02-04
	not feeling quite ecstatic but update has worked for everybody.

	But, I'm using the snippet_connection for everything.  it works now since i'm updating miscThings.

	i think i want to get rid of all the database connections from config/database.php and insert the snippet connection and the data connection.

	i also need to get the user and misc things tables linked

	we need to use the db to get the default connections 

	it's making it look like we need at least one more kind of lookup/setup
	ppp pulldown pulldown pulldown

https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/eloquent/the-sql-select-distinct-statement
Fluent:

DB::table('table_name')->distinct()->get(['column_name']);

Eloquent:

MyModel::distinct()->get(['column_name']);

we added in some of the old routes and it got started asking for a login

now, we need to modify the link to indexreports in indexmain because I added id as a parameter to index reports

we had to do something here

PHP Youtube and Vimeo Video Downloader Script
https://www.phpclasses.org/package/10144-PHP-Download-YouTube-or-Vimeo-videos.html

2017-02-07
	The login is somehow working again!  i know i changed (or added) something and then un-commented all of the 'new' stuff and we were back in business.  Miscthings controlller is the best guy and does the most things and uses the best technology but he's way more complicated than everybody needs to be

	i want to move some of those string generators over to DEH

<a href="{{ URL::route($node_name.'.reportDefMenuEdit', $parameters = array('id'=>$id, 'what_we_are_doing'=>'maintain_modifiable_fields','coming_from'=> 'reportDefMenuEdit')) }}" class="btn mycart-btn-row2">maintain_modifiable_fields</a>

i think we can start updating the buttons 
All buttons should work for the demo (ya think)
ppv_update et all should return to repDefMenuEdit after update

i'd like to make the query ro array store values instead of index values so i'll need something to find the bad ones and correct them as well as the logic to make what's there work after the changes.

more advanced queries at least show task

both snippet add and data add have yet to be upgraded

i gotta get back over and get gohoooa's blog back up

couldn't a query find all of the records we're looking for
more to do but this list is already getting long
here's lots of cleanup as well

i wanna start loading the default values for the two connections from the database
i think that will mean less has to be defined for the controller screen.

update from reportDefMenuEdit should return there

programmerutilities menu shows up
the adds and the menuing should probably come first
adds for sure
2017-02-09
	the conversion from indexes to values continues.  it's compounded by the fact that we're trying to correct bad ones automatically. (if the value is numeric, we assume it's an indexed array and do a look up on the spot.) 

	building the query isn't handling this correctly right now but it looks like we're doing the conversion right on the update

2017-02-10
	things are in better shape than they feel.
	there are no busines rules; hence marching thru a null array abends. i'm hoping making the paddining routine in working_arrays work the way i want (how many blanks do i want on the end of each array) will fix this
2017-02-14
	I deleted all my cookies for other reasons.

	i think i got the padding working right.  So, we're off to get all the buttons working

	first are the adds.  the report definition name and the others.
2017-02-16
	It's so much nicer doing it the new way.
	we want to make it look like the new update

	the problem with kill is you have to reload your databases.  i do need a more recent backup since i changed the way the indexing works.but not everybody is self correcting

	compact is the opposite of extract 
	extract($var_array, EXTR_PREFIX_SAME, "wddx");
	echo "$color, $size, $shape, $wddx_size\n";
2017-02-17
	The adds have been a lot harder than they should have been.
	A button points you to a route that points you at a controller and off you go
	Input a form, validate and insert or return with errors.

	I guess i need to go thru this one more time.

	A resource controller gets you all of the standard crud methods
	i don't think i'm using them in miscThings

	I'm thinking i want a miscThing Controller but the miscThings controller is doing lost of other stuff and maybe we can do the sqlcalls in the table controller instead of the miscThings controller  something like ::MiscThing

	Anyhow, I'm just going to try and 'clone' how we do the add in example and do the same thing with miscThings

	All that create is go to a form to accept the input data
2017-02-18-19
	I thought it was close and then it slipped away
	i get errors and the messages appear on an update just like they're supposed to
	but on an add, I can see that the validation is taking place but i see no errors

	i cannot see how the validation is returning the error messages in one case and not the other

2017-02-20
	Turns out i was passing an errors array to the view which (apparently) fucked up the real errors.  i removed that and we're FINALLY on to the add of the data record.
	(a very distracted past couple weeks for no reason other than laziness?)

	i don't feel i've put enough in the 'data model' controller.

	i guess what i mean is that there are an awful lot of db calls in miscThings.  It looks like the example does it all in the data model; miscThings is more of an app that makes db calls

	it sure is nice; now that it's working and i can use it to lookk at shit
	i do want to see if i can get distinct to work with a raw query
	but i want to try doing a miscThing::ceate()

	maybe i can create a report_definition that accepts all the fields i need to require.  Table_name and node_name are required fields
2017-02-21
	feels a bit circular.
	created report_definition_rules rport which defines the minimum fields to create a report_definition record.

	i got this hooked in with the initialize a new report button and that works fine. However, just editing comes up with a different set of rules so that's not quite working.  But, being able to define the modifiable fields using the app is GREAT! (and pretty easy to implement).  We defined a property to the class asking to define the report-id for the add.
2017-02-22
	the above works!

	i keep forgetting to mention that (i forgot)

	it's always a little deceptive on the screens in that you see an add button.  What exactly are you adding a new one of. 
2017-02-23
	it's proving difficult to pass the business_rules_array to the create module so, i'm going to:
	1. make a new function create_w_rules_id 
	2. corresponding route
	3. pass it to the create view so it can get passed to the store
2017-02-24
	it displays the right update and add screen but applies the report define business rules
2017-02-25 
	spent too much of yesterday scanning images
	you can rotate an image one hundredth of a degree in gimp!
	convert 100_0945.JPG -auto-level -compress none 18asample.tif
	tesseract 12asample.tif 12aoutputfile

	the business rules are tied to the report.  Either an add or modify needs to apply the same set of rules.

	david.stokes@oracle.com
	http://www.unofficialmysqlguide.com/

	some screen shots of the lookups
	we need a few more fields and a database backup soon

	once a database is identified (in the connection), we know all the tables
	we know who's active by matching the database tables to table controllers table names.
	Those who are active are in the main menu
	you can inactivate a table controller (new field) by setting a flag in the definition
	we need new code to go out to miscThins and get the fields that we defined when we created the table_controller 

2017-03-06
	business rules isn't working for database connection 
		snippet name is supposed to be required

	ii feel invigorated now that most stuff is working

	there's still a on of little things

	i'm feeling like i'm finally starting to see the miscThings controller as a class.
	All the other tables can extend miscThings and the stuff will be there for every other file as well; provided we define a controller for them. maybe we'll include

	maybe we can put in the env?

	left or right buttons
	vertical or horizontal display
	fields for the other three like business_rules (encompassing the field_name, r_o and value arrays)

→hi,

→i have continual battles with passwords. Am i alone? I have two domains and can not add a contact?

Samantha: Let me check one moment please

→sbblues.org & gohoooa.org

Samantha: Thank you, to maintain the security of your account can you please verify the first 4 characters of your cPanel password

→314N

Samantha: Thank you

Samantha: I do see a new contact created with the email info@gohoooa.org it just hasn't been enabled yet and there is no name

→i tried doing that as a test

Samantha: ok

→why isn't is enabled yet?

Samantha: You would have had to enable it when you created it

Samantha: I can enable it for you

→please and tell me how to do it

Samantha: It has been enabled

Samantha: When you are creating the account you will see Tick to configure as a sub-account with client area access with a box beside it you need to click on that box

→and i want to add the real person back. how to enable it?

→i'll try it again

Samantha: You could just edit the one you already have in there

→i don't see the one you enabled

Samantha: When you go to Contacts/Sub-Accounts it should automaitcally be on the one you created

→you don't mind that i think it should apper in my client area in the section marked contacts?

→appear

Samantha: It does it says new contact

→and where is he?

Samantha: Because you didn't put a name in the name field that is what it defaults to

→the one you enabled

→so i can edit him; not make a newcontact

Samantha: Right if you click on new contact under your contacts it will allow you to edit that one

→he has a name

→new, contact

Samantha: Right that is the one that I enable

Samantha: enabled

→and where is that enable flag?

Samantha: Under the phone number you will see Activate Sub-Account then Under that it says Tick to configure as a sub-account with client area access with a box with a check mark in it, before I enabled it there was no check mark

→i had that checked

Samantha: It wasn't checked when I went in

→so you should be able to log in with that new email?

Samantha: Yes with the password you set for that user

→i'll reset it right now. oh, and let me change the email address while i'm here

Samantha: Ok

→ok it's jghere@me.com

→and 20Leslee17!

→are you going to try it?

Samantha: I was able to get in without an issue

→ok thanks

Samantha: Your welcome, is there anything else I can assist you with today?

→i'd like him to only be able to update sbblues.org stuff

Samantha: This is only giving him access to the client area

→he can't get to cpanel?

Samantha: Yes he can, he would need to click on the hosting plan then login to cpanel

Samantha: but he has access to both your plans not just sbblues.org

→i don't know how to stop that

Samantha: You can't

→seems silly. All this just to change his email password without telling me

Samantha: You could have just given him the cpanel login details for that domain

→thankyou for your help

Samantha: Your welcome, is there anything else I can assist you with today?

→not yet

Samantha: Have a great day !

David H.: Hello

→i am having the goddamnest time setting a password

→did you get that

→hello??

David H.: I am here.

David H.: What is the domain on the account .

→sbblues.org gohoooa.org

David H.: So what is going on exactly, you said you are having issues setting a password?

David H.: is it not accepting what you are changing it to?

→yes but says it does

→the screen is fucked up. It shows the emil addresses where the password goes?

→And, then, when Firefox asks you if you want to save the password, it shows the zip code in the email address field

David H.: That's weird, have you tried it in a different browser?

→No, firefox is all i run

→linux

→It's your code, you pass the wrong field in two places

→i must have typed in the same password 30 time (2 time when you try to change it.)

→It says it was successful and then the update fails

David H.: What is the password you trying to set it to

→the login fails. they say the update worked but it doesn't4

→you don't get that same behaviour

→i have two that work, but the first contact fails repeatedly for me

→two contacts that i can login as

→20Leslee17!

→you disappeared?

David H.: Sorry I am still here, I am looking into the client area right now .

David H.: I did a moment ago , I am using firefox as well

David H.: but then it corrected itself after I reset the browser .

David H.: And now it is logging me in with no issue, using the password you supplied me .

David H.: Sorry I signed on using the info@gohoooa.org contact address

David H.: 20Leslee17! is what I used

David H.: But it worked for info@gohoooa.org

David H.: as well

David H.: It worked for both on this end actually .

David H.: It worked with that as well, and I just retested it with 20Leslee17! and it also worked .

David H.: Something is being weird, I will have it looked at asap, I cleared my cache and it still works for me .

	I have lost it (I hope it's temporary)
	There are several diferent web pages related to virtualbox all purporting to have a solution for reinstalling virtualbox
	 .  Completely uninstall?  I could still bring up the gui after one of those.  I have tried them all.  Apparently, there was abug in 5.0.16 which is what i attempted to install.  My apps would not come up and did not list in the list of shared folders during vagrant up.  i reinstalled vagrant several times but it always wants to download a fresh version of laravel/homestead which takes an hour and a half with my connection.  i finally decided vagrant was not the culprit.  this was all on my brand new 16.04 machine so i was quite unhappy.  i attempted to go back to 5.0.14 and then to 5.0.  At one point, i downloaded and attempted to install the x386 version.  I am running a 64bit i5 so that just created a big mess.  i think i did an --auto-remove and cleaned upmost of that.

	i split my vagrant and virtualbox downloads into two separate folders

	i've lost my drive on this but it's an issue that has to be resolved.

	Homstead.yaml is fucked up again
	FUCK!! i hate this.

	Vagrantfile gets changed to look like homestead.rb?
	/home/stu/Homestead/scripts/homestead.rb

	then homestead.yaml starts giving you error messages but they're not quite right and you can't seem to fix it.

	i destroyed the vm and started over.  
	i was entering my login stuff in l5_larablues2.dev so i feel pretty good that i got the app up.  the config/app.php file is improved and more up to date  I don't like having to rebuild the database but it's not that bad.  

	i think it was something else besides Homestead.yaml that was to blame but we'll find out soon enough

	i still need to add a few new fields but i want to insert them after some existing field.
